- filter
- sort
- scopes

### The description
Given a json object that you'll retrieve asynchronously from [this file](https://github.com/feedhenry-training/odbc-integrations/blob/master/cloud/baseball_teams.min.json), **create a table** that: 
- Lets you sort on the handful of attributes
- Allows you to filter down the list via an input box.
